* Customizations

Emacs has a bit of an annoying habit of adding things to your init
file without telling you.  This becomes a problem when you keep your
init file in version control and then use the init file for multiple
machines.  Most of the time this is an inconvienence because you are
having to commit things that emacs has added, not you.  But it also
can be a pain-in-the-ass when it causes commit conflicts.

So keep customize stuff in it's own file and then add that file to git
ignore.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Customizations ==========================================
;; keep all emacs customizations in file that is not
;; part of the repo.
(setq custom-file "~/.emacs-custom")
(load custom-file 'noerror)
#+end_src

* Private

Like in customize, we need to keep things like passwords and API keys
out of the main init file which is in a public github repo.

The solution is to encrypt the file using gpg.
