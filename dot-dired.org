* Dired

Dired is a big deal in Emacs.  It's a full featured file manager that
can trim your beard, bake a pie and even freeze icecream if you don't
forcibly stop it from doing so.

There are a few things that Dired can do that blow away any GUI file
manager.  One of my personal favorites is [[https://masteringemacs.org/article/wdired-editable-dired-buffers][WDired]] which turns Dired
listings into /Editable Dired Buffers/.  Needless to say, this is one
of those features you will finding your self using constantly.

Another is to be able to run shell commands on marked files.

#+begin_quote
Of all the hidden gems in Dired, this is one of my favorites: the
ability to run arbitrary shell commands on marked files – and if it’s
a file extension known to Dired, it will suggest a default action:
untarring .tar.gz files; displaying .pdf files; and much more!

-- [[https://masteringemacs.org/article/dired-shell-commands-find-xargs-replacement][Dired Shell Commands: The find & xargs replacement]] - Mastering Emacs
#+end_quote

We use one aspect of this feature to guess which external application
to open a file with, which we have set below.

We have also set up Dired-Ranger which adds functionality of copying
and moving files between windows like in an orthodox file manager.

I know that I just use a fraction of Dired's features, so I do
recommend spending some time reading the Info Manual for Dired,
Dired+, Dired-x and the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredMode][EmacsWiki page]] for Dired.

I had forgotten about this command.  In Dired, apply shell command to
marked files by pressing =!=.  This is a nice way of opening media
files in an external application from inside Dired.

;; This package provides a way to reuse the current dired buffer to
;; visit another directory (rather than creating a new buffer for the
;; new directory).  Optionally, it allows the user to specify a name
;; that all such buffers will have, regardless of the directory they
;; point to.

I've had this installed forever and I'm still not sure how much it
helps keep the number of Dired buffers down....

** Hiding Details & ls Switches

Over the years I have revisited this problem over and over, but keep
coming back to ls switches.  All other methods are commented out.

*** ls Switches
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3cd21a66-6be3-4bde-9e15-01c700196081
:END:

This is my prefered method for showing/hiding files in dired lists.
There are other methods but this is as fast as the others and has most
of the power of the ls command going for it.

Default for `ls switches' in Dired C-u s

Must contain `l'.  Hide group, owner, and make file sizes
human readable.  Adding an `a' will show hidden dot-files.

switches.  

Commented out for now.

I've also played around with this on several occasions and in the end
keep going back to ls switches.

Commented Out.

** Recursive Delete

I believe that `top' is the default setting, but I am leaving this
here to remind me....

#+begin_quote
Whether Dired deletes directories recursively.  If nil, Dired will not
delete non-empty directories.  ‘always’ means to delete non-empty
directories recursively, without asking.  This is dangerous!

‘top’ means to ask for each top-level directory specified by the Dired
deletion command, and delete its subdirectories without asking.

** Dired Ranger
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9a3faaa2-6052-4198-ab4e-1815de588bc1
:END:

I have been a long-time user of the kde orthodox filemanger called
Krusader.  But I'm finding myself using Dired more than Krusader.  The
two pane approach to file management is very good for copying things
between directories.  Dired Ranger provides keybindings to treat two
dired windows in the same frames like it was an orthodox file
manager.  Krusader ssh support has somewhat crapped out and is a pain
in the ass if a directory is password protected.  Tramp makes all of
this very easy, you can even bookmark and link to remote directories
using Tramp so I am using this more and more.  The only thing I'm
still using Krusader for is when moving very large files -- I can
leave it running in another workspace and I don't have to wait for
emacs to finish before doing something else.
